R to reset the simulation

T to unpaused the simulation at the start

Y frame to frame (don't work if the simulation is unpaused)

E to throw the cochonnet

I to increase the power of the shot (by 0.5)

K to decrease the power of the shot (by -0.5)

Be careful the power is not reinitialized at each new ball

The game simply loop with the launch of the cochonnet, then the 6 balls, again and again...
